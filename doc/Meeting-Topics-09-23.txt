Progress ==========================================================================
1. selenium browser automation
	hot words crawling from Google Trend (6254)
	advertisement list crawling from Google Search (2795)
	advertisement visiting with selenium 
2. simhash-py
	hash algorithm, hash key, clustering algorithms


Questions to answer ==========================================================================
1. Robustness
a. Timing: When are we going to grab the content and compute simhash?
The page could deliver bad content after a while, which simply bypasses our detection.
b. Structure vs. Text: How are we going to define cloaking?

2. Privacy and Attack Model
Attack Model: get simhash, want to find out content
Simhash: One-wayness
Attacker could not get content

Attack Model: get URL and corresponding simhash, want to find out some sensitive field on that page, e.g. name
Collision probability: Pr[h(x) = h(y)] = sim(x,y)
Attacker could not do dictionary attack on sensitive field of that page. Because feature set is large and difference in several features doesnâ€™t cause the simhash to change

3. Properties of simhash. Is it distributive? commutative? How many difference in features introduce cloaking? Always?
what simhash essentially captures? Show several (very) simple cases and compute/compare actual simhash results on them. This has to be (almost always) done when you are introducing/using some distance measures to the new problem.

4. Model Learning Algorithm
Mixed gaussian dist? would be better fit for this problem since we have multiple clusters.


Next Steps ==========================================================================
1. Get advisor or labmates involved?
2. Set up regular meetings
3. Target Oakland or USENIX
